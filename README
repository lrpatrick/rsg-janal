Description:
An implemenation of the J-band Analysis technique

File system should be set up with the following directories:

bin
docs
input
lib
models
output

Non-standard python dependancies (without source code included here):

uncertainties


Notes:

-- Commit on 11-08-2016
    included configuration files for all input information
    chi-squared calculation includes a normalisation of 1/Npix.
    This appears to be neccessary in order to recover test input parameters

-- Currently, users must edit rsgjanal.py to include their input files.
This is done on line 154 where odata is defined.

-- The structure of the input files is important.
Input file 1 includes the observed spectra in the format:
0:wavelength-axis
1-n: spec1, spec2, ..., specN

Input file 2 contains information on the observations in the format:
0: ID
1-14: Photometry:B err V err R err I err J err H err K err
15-16: res. err
17: S/N

(this should be updated to remove the optical photometry!)

Work flow:

Read in model grids (readdata.ReadMod)
>
Read in Observations(readdata.ReadObs)
>
Resample models & Degrade models (contfit.specsam & res.degrade)
>
Match spectra (rsgjanal.py using cc.crosc)
>
compute chisq grid (chisq.chigrid)
>
Estimate bestfit parameters (bestfit.BestFit)
>
Write outlines (rsgjanal.outfiles)
