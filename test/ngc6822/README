README file to describe tests undertaken

Three main tests:
1. Using a model as input spectrum at model resolution and sampling
i.e. fit model to model

2. Using a model at the resolution and sampling of the observed ngc6822 spectra

3. Using the real data

For tests 1 & 2 use a wide range of model input, from NGC6822, NGC300, LMC,
SMC, etc. As many real stars as I can get parameters for!
Make sure I test the algorithm across the all of parameter space.

Results:
1. By taking the min() of the chisq-array we recover the parameters exactly
  -- This uses a just the NGC6822 stars

2. Using the same small sample we recover parameters exactly.
  -- Increasing noise gives results, see fullreg-test2v3.png with small noise
     and fullreg-test2v2.png with a larger noise level
