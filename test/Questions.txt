Description: Queries about the RSG J-Analysis

For Ben:
Questions:
1.  What is sigma in equation 1 of Davies et al. 2015 (MC stuff)?
    "error on the line-strength, determined by the S/N" Davies et al. 2015
    "line strenght == continuum - central line depth"   Davies et al. 2015
    "associated error spectrum" Zach's thesis
    Ben:
"I fit a gaussian to the line profile, including the error spectrum as
the measurement errors, and the error on the peak I get back is the
error on the line strength. Make sense?"



For me:

1. Do the errors increase when the noise in a model is increased?
    -- errors increase slightly ...
    -- The contours on all of the parameters increase

2. Where in the parameter space can we recover the parameters?
    -- Sometimes we get +/- 0.0 for errors from repeating the fit 10 times

3. Occasionally switching off the continuum fitting procedure changes the fit values
    -- For the majority of stars this does not change the parameters
    -- Individual cases where it does change parameters:
        -- RSG7: Parameters very close to edge of grid i.e. combination of mt = 3.0 & logg = 0.75
